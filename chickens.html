    <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus)</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">domesticated
            form</a> of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus),
        originally native to Southeast Asia. It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and is one of the most
        common
        and widespread domesticated animals in the world. Chickens are primarily kept for their meat and eggs, though
        they
        are also kept as pets.</p>

    <p>As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, with more than 50 billion birds produced annually
        for consumption. Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat and egg
        production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. Chickens are social animals
        with complex vocalizations and behaviors, and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many
        societies. Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.</p>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds,
        and the wings are short.[20] Wild junglefowl can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles are too
        heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[20]
        Newly hatched chicks of both modern and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
        however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb)
        of a heritage chicken of the same age.</p>

    <h3>Reproduction and life-cycle</h3>
    <p>To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen (a circle dance), often lowering
        the wing which is closest to the hen.[36] The dance triggers a response in the hen[36] and when she responds to
        his call, the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in
        which the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the female is unreceptive, she runs
        off; otherwise, she crouches, and the male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the
        male does a tail-bending display.</p>
